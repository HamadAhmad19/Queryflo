# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Add About component import to App.js
  - Import the aboutCompCall component from the correct path
  - Use PascalCase naming convention for the import (AboutCompCall)
  - Place import statement with other component imports
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Add About route to the Routes configuration
  - Add new Route element for the About page in App.js
  - Set the path prop to "/about"
  - Set the element prop to render the AboutCompCall component
  - Position the route logically within the existing Routes structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Test the About route functionality
  - Create a simple test to verify the About route renders correctly
  - Test navigation to /about URL displays the aboutCompCall component
  - Verify existing routes (home and pricing) still function properly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.3_
