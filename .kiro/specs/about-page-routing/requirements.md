# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds routing functionality for an About page to the existing React application. The application currently has routing set up for the home page and pricing page, and we need to add a similar route for the About page using the existing `aboutCompCall.jsx` component.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate to an About page via a dedicated URL route, so that I can access information about the company or service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to "/about" THEN the system SHALL display the About page component
2. WHEN the About page loads THEN the system SHALL render the existing aboutCompCall component
3. WHEN a user accesses the About route THEN the system SHALL maintain the same routing behavior as other pages (pricing, home)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the About route to be integrated into the existing routing structure, so that it follows the same patterns as other routes in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the About route is added THEN the system SHALL use the same React Router structure as existing routes
2. WHEN the About route is implemented THEN the system SHALL import and use the existing aboutCompCall component
3. WHEN the routing is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing routes without breaking functionality
