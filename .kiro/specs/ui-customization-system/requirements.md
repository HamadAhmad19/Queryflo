# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide QueryFlo users with the ability to customize various UI elements throughout the SQL interview preparation platform, including font sizes, element positioning, spacing, and other visual properties. The system will allow users to personalize their experience across all pages (Home, About, Pricing, Partnership, Comprehensive Guide) by adjusting typography, layout positioning, and visual styling to meet their preferences and accessibility needs. The customization will work with the existing centralized CSS architecture and component-based structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QueryFlo user, I want to adjust font sizes throughout the platform, so that I can improve readability while studying SQL concepts and accommodate my visual preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the customization settings THEN the system SHALL display font size controls for different text elements (main headings like "Ace SQL Interview", section titles, body text, navigation links, button text)
2. WHEN a user adjusts a font size slider or input THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the change to the corresponding text elements across all pages (Home, About, Pricing, Partnership, Comprehensive Guide)
3. WHEN a user changes font sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper text hierarchy and proportional scaling between h1, h2, h3, and paragraph elements
4. WHEN font sizes are modified THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable within existing layout containers and doesn't break the responsive design
5. WHEN a user refreshes the page or navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL persist the custom font size settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QueryFlo user, I want to adjust the positioning and spacing of UI elements, so that I can create a layout that works better for my study workflow and screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses positioning controls THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust margins, padding, and spacing for key sections (header navigation, content containers, benefits cards, feature sections, footer)
2. WHEN a user modifies element positioning THEN the system SHALL update the layout in real-time without breaking the existing responsive design or media queries
3. WHEN positioning changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain proper alignment and visual hierarchy across all QueryFlo pages
4. WHEN elements are repositioned THEN the system SHALL ensure no content becomes inaccessible or overlaps inappropriately, especially for the header navigation and footer links
5. WHEN spacing is adjusted THEN the system SHALL preserve the overall QueryFlo design integrity and maintain usability across different screen sizes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and manage multiple customization presets, so that I can quickly switch between different UI configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates custom settings THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save the configuration as a named preset
2. WHEN a user saves a preset THEN the system SHALL store all current customization settings under the specified name
3. WHEN a user views saved presets THEN the system SHALL display a list of all available presets with descriptive names
4. WHEN a user selects a preset THEN the system SHALL apply all associated customization settings immediately
5. WHEN a user wants to modify presets THEN the system SHALL allow editing, renaming, and deleting of existing presets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset customizations to default settings, so that I can easily return to the original design if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the customization panel THEN the system SHALL provide a clearly labeled reset option
2. WHEN a user clicks reset THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before applying changes
3. WHEN reset is confirmed THEN the system SHALL restore all UI elements to their original default settings
4. WHEN default settings are restored THEN the system SHALL clear any stored custom preferences
5. WHEN reset is complete THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the action was successful

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the customization interface to be intuitive and accessible, so that I can easily make adjustments without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the customization panel THEN the system SHALL display controls organized in logical categories (Typography, Layout, Spacing)
2. WHEN a user interacts with controls THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview of changes
3. WHEN controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL include clear labels, tooltips, and help text
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL ensure all customization controls are accessible via keyboard
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide undo/redo functionality for recent modifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a QueryFlo user, I want my customizations to work consistently across all pages and components, so that my personalized study experience is maintained throughout the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizations are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure changes affect all relevant components across all QueryFlo pages (Home, About, Pricing, Partnership, Comprehensive Guide)
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling based on user preferences, including the reusable Header and Footer components
3. WHEN new components are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically apply existing customization settings to maintain consistency
4. WHEN the QueryFlo application updates THEN the system SHALL preserve user customizations and apply them to new or modified components
5. WHEN customizations conflict with responsive design THEN the system SHALL gracefully adapt settings to maintain usability across different screen sizes while preserving the existing media query breakpoints
